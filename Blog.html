                    <article>
                        <p><h3><b>4. Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why?</b></h3></p>
                        <p><b>Em vs rem vs %</b></p>
                        <p><b>Em</b> : “em” is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt. </p>
                        <p>Ems are scalable in nature, so 2em would equal 24pt, .5em would equal 6pt, etc. </p>
                        <p>Em are becoming increasingly popular in web documents due to scalability and their mobile-device-friendly nature. </p>
                        <p>While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, <b> rem</b> is only relative to the html (root) font-size. em gives the ability to control an area of a design. As in, scale the type in that specific area relatively. </p>
                        <p>rem gives the ability to scale type across the entire page easily.</p> 
                        <p><b>Percent (%):</b> The percent unit is much like the “em” unit, save for a few fundamental differences. </p>
                        <p>First, the current font-size is equal to 100% (i.e. 12pt = 100%). While using the percent unit, your text remains fully scalable for mobile devices and for accessibility.</p>
                        <p>1em = 12pt = 16px = 100%</p>
                        <p>Both the em and the percent units are identical, but in application, they actually have a few minor differences that are important to consider.</p>
                        <p>we used the percent unit as our base font-size (on the body tag). If you change your base font-size from percent to ems (i.e. body {font-size: 1em ;}), you probably will not notice a difference. </p>
                        <p>If we see what happens when “1em” is our body font-size, and when the client alters the “Text Size” setting of their browser (this is available in some browsers, such as Internet Explorer).</p>
                        <p>When the client’s browser text size is set to “medium,” there is no difference between em and percent. </p>
                        <p>When the setting is altered, however, the difference is quite large. On the “Smallest” setting, ems are much smaller than percent, and when on the “Largest” setting, it’s quite the opposite, with em displaying much larger than percent. </p>
                        <p>While some could argue that, the em units are scaling as they are truly intended, in practical application, the em text scales too abruptly, with the smallest text becoming hardly legible on some client machines. </p>

                            <p class="title">detail explanation of change in CSS3</p>
                            <article>
                                <p><b>6. Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3 </b></p>
                                <p>CSS: is the visual language of the web, controlling everything visual about a website, from, from background colors and navigation bars to fonts and text alignment.</p>
                                <p>CSS allows developers and designers to create the style and layout of a page and add global styling to all pages.</p>
                                <p><b>In CSS3, it evolved to do even more.</b></p>
                                <p><h3><b>✔✔ Mobile-first mentality</h3> </b></p>
                                <p>CSS3 inherently support responsive design, and is equipped to handle media queries. Media queries are calls made by the code to determine what device and size screen a user is viewing the site on.</p>
                                <p>This adds a completely new responsive design capability to the CSS repertoire.</p>
                                <p><h3><b>✔✔ Module-based code</b></h3></p>
                                <p>All of the old CSS specifications have been migrated over to the new version and divided into smaller pieces.</p>
                                <p><b>⭐CSS3 module include:</b></p>
                                <p>Selector, The box model module, Backgrounds and borders, Text effects…</p>
                                <p><h3><b>✔✔ Web font support gives designers access to weigh more than just ”web safe” fonts</b></h3></p>
                                <p>Before CSS3, designers could only use “web safe” fonts to be 100% sure that the fonts would always display the same on everyone’s machine. </p>
                                <p>Web safe fonts are that every single computer has installed and recognizes. </p> 
                                <p>If a designer used common fonts like Time New Roman or Arial, they could pretty much guarantee that any user would view their site as it was intended. </p>
                                <p>However, if they wanted to use a rare font, if it was not supported by user’s machine, it would default back to a web safe font.</p>
                                <p>In CSS3, special font like those available via Google Fonts and Typecast.
                                    These fonts can either be download onto a server or run though the CSS code, which is called right within the CSS code.
                                    </p>
                                <p><h3><b>✔✔ It enables faster development, and faster load times</b></h3></p>
                                <p>What used to require background images, CSS3 can now achieve with visual enhancement, which saves developers time in production. </p>
                                <p>This cuts down on calls and load times for numerous image because these effects are built into the code. Also, page load faster.</p>
                                <p><h3><b>✔✔ Create 2D and 3D transformations, animations, and transitions</b></h3></p>
                                <p>This effect allows elements on page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a different color. </p>
                                <p>For the first time, elements created in CSS can move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or Flash code. </p>
                                <p>With transitions, an element can seamlessly change size and color. </p>
                                <p><h3><b>✔✔ New color and image effects</b></h3></p>
                                <p>CSS3 supports new colors (RGBA, HSL, and HSLA) and gradient colors, and allows for adjustment to opacity.</p>
                                <p>It supports a rounded image corners, an effect required a lot of formatting and Photoshop work to achieve before.</p>
                                <p><h3><b>✔✔ Box-sizing has fixed some annoying alignment problems</b></h3></p>
                                <p>Box sizing allows developers to get the sizing of elements right without having to subtract dimension for padding and borders. </p>
                                <p>With the box-sizing property, the padding and border are included the height and width</p>
